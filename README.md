# Text-To-Hashtag
This converts inputted text into text with a hashtag in front of it. Good for Instagram or generating tags for social media

This is just a beginner test file for me, I'm uploading projects as I work on them. 
I wanted to create something that could help me generate hashtags a little bit faster without having to go to a hashtag converter website.

Only the code at the bottom is important.

All of the other code in comments is my "attempts" to make the problem work. I'm just simply saving this for "scratch work".
